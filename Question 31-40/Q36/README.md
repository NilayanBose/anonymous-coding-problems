# Problem

The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after `n` growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is `n = 5`, the calculations are as follows:

```
Period  Height
0          1
1          2
2          3
3          6
4          7
5          14
```
