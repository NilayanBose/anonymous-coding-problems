[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/debdutgoswami/anonymous-coding-problems.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/debdutgoswami/anonymous-coding-problems)

This repository contain solutions of the coding problems I solve.</br>

My main motive behind creating this repository is to give everyone small coding problems to solve. I will be uploading solutions to all the questions. Languages I would be using are Python, C and Java. </br>

If you are having difficulty in solving any coding problem, feel free to email me the question and I will try to solve the problem.</br>
And if you think you have a better solution to a problem (in terms of complexity) then also feel free to email me the solution or raise a merge request and I will definitely look into it. </br>
Email: debdutgoswami@gmail.com</br>

## request to everyone </br>
Do not directly look into the solutions. Try to solve it on your own and then I you get stuck anywhere then you can look in the solutions.</br>
